# Readme: Skeleton Chat

This is the initial setup required to start playing with [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

It is only meant to be run locally using `python manage.py runserver`  -- no channel layers have been configured.

Once the server is running, access [http://127.0.0.1:8000/chatdemo/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/chatdemo/) in multiple browser windows to start chatting with yourself.
